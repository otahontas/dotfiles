## TODO / Known issues

- TMUX reports exit code 1 when starting on mac. This happens only on start and doesn't
  really affect anything else. Probably something happening with the wrapper script /
  zsh settings
- change to Noir theme for unified experience?
- change to Kitty? Supports tabs, true color and images
- Add setting system preferences via commands to macos script
- Add restore app settings from backups to macos script
