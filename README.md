# Dotfiles

This repo includes my configurations for macOS. I used to keep here a list of highlights such as what is terminal I use, but it was always out of sync. Guess I change my mind too often ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Feel free to sniff around.

## (Fresh) Installation

- Prepare:
  - Cleanup any previous install
  - Set up firware password
- Run graphical setup:
  - Clear NVRAM
  - Make your way through Setup Assistant
- Open terminal and run installation script.

## Generic todo

- add offlineimap
- add notmuch
- add sync for calendar & contacts
- add khal & khard
- add khard as addressbook source to aerc
- add confs for gui programs
- convert install script to "no-script" / add more prompts, don't just install everything
